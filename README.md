# CyberSpurs

# Instructions
Launch CyberSpurs.exe and click play when the menu loads.

# Extra information
There should be signs explaining most things in the game, but if those are not clear, you will begin in the tutorial level, and step in to the cylindrical teleporter into level one, where you will go to the end of the level and find a key, which will open the door to the boss teleporter and spawn in more enemies. In the boss room, you will fight the beastmaster, who will patrol the boss arena and shoot the player if seen. Once she reaches 50% health, she enters phase 2, where she will summon wolves and shoot the player more frantically. In order to damage her in this phase, both of the wolves must be defeated. Once the beastmaster is defeated, a tally of all the enemies you have defeated and whether you have taken damage at all in the playthrough will show. Your star count is dependant on your performance in these categories. We did not outline how many enemies to kill in order to get more stars, but for completion purposes, 20 enemies killed will get you one star, and 30 enemies killed will get you two stars. The last star is tacked on if you have completed the level without sustaining damage. We did not include this information in the player's HUD as we believe this will encourage more replayability. The replay button can be clicked in order to play another round.

# Bugs
One of the most persistent bugs that we thought we patched out was the enemies moving weirdly and pausing for no reason while chasing the player. In the editor, all the enemies move smoothly, but we could not find a way to fix this once the game was built (Has something to do with the navmesh). Other than that, there are no other prevalent bugs that are detrimental to the playing experience other than one of the shadows not allowing enemies to be taken down, but it is a small area and not very noticeable. Another bug that might occur, but has not occured for us yet, would be that the player might spawn out of the map instead of at the beginning, just close and open the exe again and it should work.
